Most important skill of a porgrammer
 - Solving problems

Python is a high-level language

Interpreter - executes one line at a time, like a language interpreter
Compiler - converts the entire program first, like a book compliler 

Types of Errors
- Syntax - related to punctuations
- Runtime or exceptions - for example, dividing by 0
- Semantic errors : you framed or coded the program wrong - eg, finding the destination using an incorrect map

- Debugging
it is like detective work - you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see
- for some people programming and debuggging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want.
