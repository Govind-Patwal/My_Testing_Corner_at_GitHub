1.1. Most important skill of a porgrammer
 - problem solving

 1.2. Algorithms
- A general step by step process for solving a problem.

1.3. The Python Programming Language
- Python is a high-level language
- can be run is a shell mode (cmd mode) or program mode (savins a .py file)

Interpreter - executes one line at a time, like a language interpreter
Compiler - converts the entire program first, like a book compliler 

1.5. More About Programs
- A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation

1.6. What is Debugging?
-  process of tracking errors down and correcting them is called debugging

Types of Errors
- Syntax - related to punctuations
- Runtime or exceptions - for example, dividing by 0
- Semantic errors : you framed or coded the program wrong - eg, finding the destination using an incorrect map

1.10. Experimental Debugging
it is like detective work - you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see
- for some people programming and debuggging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. Ie start with a program that does something and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, you you always have a running program - this concept is called 

Natural and Formal/Computer language
- Formal language - syntax comes in 2 flavors, tokens and structure
- tokens - Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements
- structure - the way the tokens are arranged

1.12 First Program - Hello World

1.13. Comments - only for humans, ignored by interpreter/complier
- in python # starts a comment
